# ðŸ’» Laptop Dataset Cleaning Using SQL
This project involves comprehensive data cleaning and transformation of a laptop dataset using pure SQL. Key tasks performed include:

Dropping unnecessary columns and NULL-filled rows

Standardizing data types (e.g., converting RAM and Weight to numeric formats)

Cleaning and formatting fields (e.g., removing "GB", "kg", rounding prices)

Categorizing and simplifying OS, GPU, CPU, and memory info

Extracting resolution, touchscreen, and storage components into structured columns

Creating backup tables and checking storage size

This project demonstrates practical data preprocessing techniques using SQLâ€”essential for real-world data analytics workflows.
